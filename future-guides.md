## Contribution Guidelines

For each study guide:

1. Create an initial outline and get feedback
2. Develop content in sections
3. Include practical examples and diagrams
4. Add references to official documentation and additional resources
5. Review for technical accuracy
6. Proofread for clarity and consistency
7. Publish and gather community feedback
8. Iterate based on feedback

## Maintenance Plan

- Review each guide quarterly for accuracy and updates
- Update guides when major version changes occur in the relevant technology
- Add new sections as technologies evolve
- Archive outdated information with clear versioning notes
